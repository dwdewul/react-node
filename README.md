# Emailify

## Warning to users:
## This is a development project and not intended for production. Do not use it for your email survey campaigns.

## The What:
Emailify is a solution for handling your email survey campaigns. You simply buy credits (1 credit = 1 campaign sent) and create your survey!

## How to use it:
You must have a Google account to log in, as it only supports OAuth for Google. Then you buy some credits! To "buy" credits, use one of
Stripe's [test cards](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards). This will not actually charge money, of course. Then click the red button on
the bottom right corner of the screen and get sending!
